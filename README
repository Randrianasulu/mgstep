PREREQUISITES

  mGSTEP is developed on an embedded Linux platform.  Periodic testing is
  conducted on Ubuntu 14.04 and OpenBSD 6.6.  All other build targets are
  untested with the latest release.  A build environment should have the
  following minimum tools and libs installed:

  BASH 3.2 (Linux) or KSH (OpenBSD)
  GNU Make 3.81.x  or OpenBSD make
  GCC 4.6.4        or newer with Objective-C support or LLVM clang

  libtiff      tiff-v3.6.1   or newer
  libffi       libffi-3.2.1  or newer
  libfreetype  Freetype 2.6  or newer  (or use internal Freetype option)

  libssl       openssl-1.0.2                     (optional)
  zlib         zlib-1.2.8                        (optional)

  libjpeg      jpeg-6b or libjpeg-turbo-1.4.1    (optional)
  libgif       giflib-4.1.6                      (optional)
  libpng16     libpng-1.6.x                      (optional)

  libopenal    openal-soft-1.18.2                (optional)
  libvorbis    libvorbis-1.3.5                   (optional)
  libogg       libogg-1.3.2                      (optional)


BUILD ENVIRONMENT

  Ubuntu 14.04 / 16.04:

    $ sudo apt-get install gobjc libssl-dev libffi-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev \
                        libtiff-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev libpng-dev \
                        libfreetype6-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev
    $ make

  OpenBSD 6.6:

    $ pkg_add -v bzip2 gcc gobjc giflib-5.1.6 jpeg-2.0.3v0 tiff-4.0.10 \
                 libffi-3.2.1p5 libiconv-1.16p0 libogg-1.3.4 libvorbis-1.3.6 \
                 openal-1.19.1v0
    $ CC=/usr/local/bin/egcc make


HOW TO BUILD

  This package builds within it's own hierarchy.  You may need to edit or
  create a platform makefile in Build/stubs to reflect your system.  If
  building on Linux where shared libraries are the default you will need
  to install the libraries or set the dynamic linker search path before
  running the tests.  See 'INSTALLATION' section below.

  At the top of the source tree (this directory) begin the build with:

    make

  Generate and set shell environment variables:

    make export
    . ./ld-export

  Build and run the Foundation tests:

    cd Foundation/Testing
    make all
    make run

  Build and run the Distributed Objects tests (optional, Linux only):

    cd Foundation/DO
    make

       *** add: "domap	538/tcp" to /etc/services if not already defined ***
    ./domap
    ./server &
    ./client

  Build and run the AppKit examples:

    cd AppKit/Testing
    make all

         *** run domap as root if DO was not disabled during build config ***
    ./run <test>.app  (e.g. ./run Workspace.app)


  Configuring the example service (Linux only, requires Distributed Objects):

    make install_user

  When you next run Edit.app the example service should be accessible
  via Edit.app's 'Edit->Services' menu.


INSTALLATION

  mGSTEP is installed by defining the 'MGSTEP_ROOT' environment variable
  so that it points to either the top of a built mGSTEP source tree or to
  the install path selected during package installation.  On platforms
  that utilize shared libraries the dynamic linker search path must also
  include the directory containing the libraries.

  Install mGSTEP (prompts for install path):

    make install


CROSS PLATFORM

  Building mGSTEP apps on Mac OS X where Cocoa is native requires several
  minor changes in the menu code and in the app's principal class.  Once
  these are in place the app will build with either mGSTEP or Cocoa.  The
  tableview example's generic Controller.m has the necessary modifications.
  To build tableview on OS X configure mGSTEP, then in AppKit/Testing enter:

    make tableview
    open tableview.app
